# Structure of the Course

## How is this course structured?

The course Human Computer Interaction (5 ECTS) is divided into modules for self-study, and several discussion and exercise sessions. The credits can be obtained by passing a written exam at the end of the semester. The exam will include questions from the self-study material, discussion sessions, guest talks and exercise assignments.

## Where can I find the material?

The course is divided into 11 Chapters that we will all cover throughout the weeks. Once completed the previous chapter with a discussion session, the content of the respective week will be accessible to you. Each chapter begins with an introduction video that you can find in fau.tv and follows with Handouts that are provided via StudOn. The content of the Chapter will be discussed in weekly sessions that are streamed via zoom and not recorded.

The learned material can be applied in a group project over the semester. The project is not mandatory to pass the course, however, the content of the exercise will also be included in the exam. The exercise sessions will not be broadcasted via zoom nor recorded.

The slides for the discussion and exercise sessions will be provided to you shortly before the session.

Additional material is linked in the StudOn folders for further deepening of the content.

## Will it be online?

The self-study material can all be obtained from the StudOn modules and folders. The discussion session will be in presence, except communicated otherwise. The in-presence sessions will not be recorded. You can not participate via Zoom.

## How do stay informed about announcements?

Announcements about the exercise or lecture will be sent via mail and posted in the HCI-forum.

## Can we record the discussion sessions?

No. It is your responsibility to plan your lecture schedule accordingly. If you cannot attend because of another lecture, think about your priorities and decide for one or the other. We encourage active participation to discuss current problems and applications of our course content, which would not be possible without personal attendance.

After taking this course, students should develop an understanding for models, methods and concepts in Human-Computer Interaction. You will further learn various approaches for desiging, implementing and validating modern User Interfaces and with it understand the advantages and drawbacks of such interfaces.

# Exercise Sessions

## Is this project mandatory?

The participation in the exercise project is voluntarily and won't be graded. The content from the exercise will also be asked in the exam.

## How do we form groups?

You can form your project group yourself, max. 8 people per group. To register your group, you need to complete task 1 but you can also register your group after any other task. To upload the task, create the group by adding the StudOn IDs of your colleagues, then you can upload the file.

# Exam

## What is the date of the exam?

For the date of the exam, we need a confirmation of the organizational authorities. As long as we do not have the confirmation, we cannot give you an exam date. As soon as we get the information, we will share it with you. Please do not contact us to ask about the exam date.

## Can we change the exam date?

The exam date cannot be changed, once it is fixed. We are aware of the fact that students from a wide variety of programs are in this course, and we cannot take all other exams into account during planning that might be at the same time.

## What is the format of the exam?

The exam is conducted as an E-Exam in presence. Questions can include Multiple Choice, Single Choice, Assignments Tasks or similar, as well as free answering questions. You are not allowed to bring any aids.

## How can we best prepare for the exam?

The exam will include questions about the self-study content, the discussion sessions, group talks and exercise content. We will not upload an exemplary exam, but discuss possible questions in the discussion sessions.

Questions in the exam will be from one of the following levels:

- **Level 1: Summarizing/Definitions/Fact Questions**  
  Level 1 questions can be answered by using facts or easily accessible information from the course resources.

- **Level 2: Analysis/Interpretation Questions**  
  Level 2 quesions can be answered after interpreting or analyzing the course material.

- **Level 3: Hypothesis/Prediction Questions**  
  To answer Level 3 questions, you need to go beyond the text from course resources and prove an understanding of the ideas in the Chapters. These questions typically require reasoning, complexity, and/or planning

- **Level 4: Critical Analysis/Evaluation/Opinion Questions**  
  Level 4 questions go well beyond the text of the lecture content. These tasks require an investigation, time to think and process multiple conditions of the problem.

## How many and which questions can you expect?

The number of questions depends on the difficulty of each question and will be based on the content of this course and assembled to be adequate for 90 minutes. Throughout the joint sessions in this semester, we will show and discuss possible questions.

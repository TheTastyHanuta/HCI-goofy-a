Dear student,

welcome to the lecture **Human Computer Interaction** (also known as **HCI**).

## Inverted Classroom

This course is held differently from the previous iteration due to the switch to a digital format. We will conduct the course in the format of an **inverted classroom**. This means that you will be introduced to new topics **outside the classroom**, i.e., you will:

- Work on lecture contents in StudOn  
- Watch lecture videos  
- Read through additional literature  
- Prepare yourself for the discussion sessions  

...**at home**.

This will provide time for a **learner-centered interactive discussion session** (previously the lecture in which you have been following the lecture content), in which we will deepen the knowledge about the topic.

However, to engage you in the content of the interactive session, it is important that you are **prepared** when joining the discussion session.  
**We will not simply repeat the content of the lecture in the discussion session.**

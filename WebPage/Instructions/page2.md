# How to Study with This Course?

## @Home Phase

Due to the nature of the online format we will not confront you with 90 minute lectures. In contrast, we structured this course into **smaller blocks of interest** that represent self-contained topics. Therefore, in each week, there will be multiple smaller blocks with specific learning objectives to be prepared **before the discussion session**.

We will provide the content for the home phase **at least one week** before the respective discussion session.

For the **@Home phase**, we will provide **learning modules** which contain:

- Videos containing lecture style information. The lecture content is mostly based on previous iterations of Human Computer Interaction  
- Lecture slides associated with the videos  
- Additional material such as literature, websites, videos, etc.

## Discussion Sessions

In contrast to traditional lectures, you will need to have a **basic understanding** of the lecture content **before** the discussion session.

> **Important:** In order to make the discussion session effective, you need to be prepared based on the learning content provided to you in the week preceding the session.

We will have different ways of interaction:

- Group discussions about the lecture content and associated solutions to the questions  
- Work on questions/exercises in smaller groups  
- Interactive whiteboards to gather information/questions  
- Discussion of open questions  
- Feedback  
- ...

## Exercises

The exercises are based on the content of the lecture and will allow you to work on a **project together with other students** during the whole semester.

You will develop your own **prototype in small groups** and thus bring the lecture content directly into practical application.

> **Important:** The principle will be the same: Please **work on the tasks before** the exercise discussion session.

## Forum

The forum will be used for:

- General communication on the course  
- Recapitulation of the lessons learnt for each single lecture  

Further notes:

- The forum is **anonymous** and there are **no stupid questions**, therefore we encourage you to use this forum actively.  
- We will supervise the forum but also encourage your **peers to help** wherever possible.  
- Please also share **interesting links, media, journal papers** in the respective threads.

# Examples & Exercises

## Example: Task-Artifact Cycle

One example for the **task-artifact cycle** is the **car**. It was once invented and designed to travel longer distances between cities.  
However, the increasing use of cars also changed the demands on the transport network in cities.

When we look at historic medieval city centres, we see a tight network of alleys, larger squares to trade in and a city wall to protect the town's inhabitants.  
At that time, individual transport did not exist as it does today, so the demands on the road network were completely different. This can still be seen in many city centers of European cities.

In recent decades, the requirements for cities have been clearly focused on the car:  
Cities today, as the example from **Dallas** shows, have been designed for the needs of cars.

This example represents the **task-artifact cycle**.  
- The invention of the artifact (car) led to new tasks (e.g. driving to other cities).  
- These new tasks in turn led to **new necessities** for city centres and transport networks, and probably the invention of **new artifacts**.

## Exercise: Mobile Phones

Humans have always had the desire to **communicate** with each other.  
With the invention of the telephone and its further development into the **smartphone**, social behaviour today has completely changed.

ðŸ’¡ *Think about:*

- How did people meet with others in **1990**, **2010**, and **today**?
- How did you communicate with your friends as a child?

---

## Exercise: Communication

People have a need to **communicate everywhere**.  
Do popular solutions such as:

- WhatsApp  
- Twitter  
- Email  

...really fulfill those needs?

Reflect and discuss.

## Exercise: Maslow's Hierarchy of Human Needs

Consider how **Maslowâ€™s hierarchy of needs** applies to **modern technologies and interfaces**.

- Which level(s) do certain apps or devices address?
- How do digital products help fulfill human psychological or social needs?
